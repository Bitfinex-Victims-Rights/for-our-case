Right now the biggest confiscation and pride of the [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/2016-bitfinex-hack), [ $12 Billion in bitcoin owed to about 80000 victims ] <br> seems as risk to be taken away from the eyes of the victims once more after a 3-year-wait,  
[ which US attorney M. Graves suggested to 82 year old Judge Colleen Kollar Kotelly. ] <br> [Victims rights are denied as of now.](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.257737/gov.uscourts.dcd.257737.202.0.pdf)  : Deadline for Objection is Jan-28. <br> You can also fill an "Anciallary Petition" now to claim ownership before forfeiture and you can make further motions like, https://www.linkedin.com/posts/franciscocavazos_pro-se-litigant-advocate-for-crypto-restitution-activity-7286963616887554048-9WhY and fill remission petition and so on.

The government is free to give the BTC back to the people and keep much or donate it.  
Instead it is currently  planned to mostly go to the island-company, 
who apparently gave everybody fake-secure multi-signature wallets with a 3rd party 
and claimed to have socialized ownership as a last resort to evade bankruptcy, yet didnt become community owned.

Most of the victims had 1 BTC or less, and might never noticed the court case until today and
the company denied to simply inform the victims, 
which the gov apparently tolerated yet. 

( Meanwhile by 2025 the same company also replaced the FED somewhat by issuing $140B USDt.)
